              I grew up in northern California in the 1970s with an artist mother,
              <a href="http://www.commonword.ca/ResourceView/2/1509" title="Jill Knuth" target="-blank">Jill Knuth</a>, and a computer scientist father, <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno" title="Don Knuth's retro website…" target="-blank">Don Knuth</a>.
              I later attended Brown University where I majored in Art and Anthropology.
              My interests in culture and design led to a Master’s degree in Material Culture from the University of Pennsylvania.

              After graduate school, in addition to being a full-time mom, I spent many years as a professional writer, editor, and proofreader.

            <p>
              Design that WORKS is a lifelong passion, as is the pursuit of harmony between form and function. I love to make things that people actually <strong>use</strong>.

              As the founder and owner of <a href="http://truejune.com" title="TrueJune Design" target="_blank">TrueJune Design</a>, I create functional, attractive, everyday jewelry that is made to last.
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="http://truejune.com" title="TrueJune Design" target="_blank">TrueJune</a> is a successful small business that I launched in 2008.
              The business has challenged me to apply creative problem solving to a wide variety of areas from photography to marketing to storage and display.
              I love the meticulous attention to detail, analyzing strategies, and in general figuring things out and making stuff work.
              I've taken my handmade business about as far as it can go. To move on, I need to do something more replicable.
