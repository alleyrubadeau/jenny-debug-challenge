              Background
            </h3>
            <p>I grew up in northern California in the 1970s with an artist mother, Jill Knuth, and a computer scientist father, Don Knuth.
              I later attended Brown University where I majored in Art and Anthropology.
              My interests in culture and design led to a Master’s degree in Material Culture from the University of Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduate school, in addition to being a full-time mom, I spent many years as a professional writer, editor, and proofreader.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design that WORKS is a lifelong passion, as is the pursuit of harmony between form and function.

          </h3>
            <p>As the founder and owner of TrueJune Design, I create functional, attractive, everyday jewelry that is made to last.</p>

            <p>TrueJune is a successful small business that I launched in 2008.
              I love to make things that people actually <strong>use</strong>. The business has challenged me to apply creative problem solving to a wide variety of areas from photography to marketing to storage and display.
              I love the meticulous attention to detail and analyzing strategies, puzzles, and potential solutions.
              As a handmade business, I've taken it about as far as it can go. To move on, I need to do something more replicable.

            Summary
          </h3>
            <p>I have lived on the west coast, the east coast, in England, Norway, and France and now find myself happily settled in Boulder, Colorado, with my husband, two sons, and two cats.
              A chronicle of my adventures can be found at jeninco.blogspot.com.
              In the evenings, between moves in Words with Friends (love the strategy and competition—hate the design), I can be found avidly pinning and repinning to my boards on Pinterest.</p>
